##Making Modifications to This Script

Obtained and unzipped the source files. Modify the run_analysis.R file at the place that need to set the path of the working directory to relect the location of the source files. 

##Project Summary

The following is a summary description of the project instructions

Create a R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##Additional Information

Information about the variables, data and transformations can be found in the CodeBook.MD file.
